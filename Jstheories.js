//indexOf() and .includes = the same thing

//1.indexOf() includes a certain element if you're searching for something 
//2.includes() includes a certain element if you're searching for something means the exact same thing

//3.What does substring mean
let word ="Barefoot";
let sub1= word.substring(0,3); //first argument is the starting index and the last index is the 3 index
//last argument is exclusive meaning is it is not included  0,4
let sub2= word.substring(4,8); 
//this is going to be foot, the last value gets indexed

//4.split the value of the function s and add join adds the value as seen in the military example

//5.Join is to use 'join'

//6.Val() method is primarily used to get the values of form elements such as input , select and textarea 

//7. Concat means to combine words

//8. slice method gets the value of the array at a specific element (1,-1) -1 gets the last value of the string
//1 gets the first value 

//9.Push element pushes an element onto the array
//The first and probably the most common JavaScript array method you will encounter is push(). 
//The push() method is used for adding an element to the end of an array

//11. for in loop works for objects remember how to do that

//12.Typeof checks the value of aa object a string or an object

//13.In an object, if the elements are in an object, then that means you have to loop using val key in a for in loop is the best for an object

//14.In recursion i've seen a pattern where when you recurse the first item it has to be (0,-1) this way it doesnt go to an infinity loop

//15.Another pattern i noticed with recursion of arrays is when you use [] this is when you want to set your return statement to an array of some sort
