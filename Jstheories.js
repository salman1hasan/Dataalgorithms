//indexOf() and .includes = the same thing

//1.indexOf() includes a certain element if you're searching for something 
//2.includes() includes a certain element if you're searching for something means the exact same thing

//3.What does substring mean
let word ="Barefoot";
let sub1= word.substring(0,3); //first argument is the starting index and the last index is the 3 index
//last argument is exclusive meaning is it is not included  0,4
let sub2= word.substring(4,8); 
//this is going to be foot, the last value gets indexed

//4.split the value of the function s and add join adds the value as seen in the military example
